**Three's a Stroud vs Aiyuk to be a Piece of $h!t**

Alright, listen up, 'cause this matchup was like watching a couple of mooks fight over the last slice of gabagool. Chris and his "Three's a Stroud" crew finally snagged a win, clocking in at 129.3 points to Ryan's less-than-stellar 113.8. Bijan Robinson was the star of the show, racking up 25.5 points like a real caporegime. Meanwhile, Ryan's boy Chris Godwin put up a massive 35.5, but it was like bringing a knife to a gunfight‚Äîain't enough when the rest of your lineup's eating spaghetti with their fingers. And let's not forget Zay Flowers, who bloomed for 22.4 points, leaving Brandon Aiyuk looking like he forgot his cleats at home. Now, if Ryan had played Alexander Mattison from the bench, maybe we'd be having a different conversation, but hey, a wrong decision is better than indecision, right? So, Chris, you get your respect this week, but remember, you got no idea what it's like to be Number One just yet.

**Las Chubacabras vs D:cker Til She Waddles**

Alright, let's dive into this little showdown between Brian's Las Chubacabras and Sean's D:cker Til She Waddles. Sean's team came out on top, 142.5 to 124.3, and frankly, Brian, you got played like a bad hand of poker. A.J. Brown and Justin Fields tried to carry your sorry crew with 23.6 and 23.7 points respectively, but Travis Etienne Jr. pulling a negative score? That's like showing up to a mob war with a water gun. Sean, on the other hand, had Garrett Wilson lighting it up with 24.7 points and George Kittle adding a solid 22.8‚Äîthese guys were the real capos of the operation. Now, Brian, you got some explaining to do. Leaving Keenan Allen's 21.1 points and Baker Mayfield's 25.9 on the bench? That's a lineup blunder worthy of a sit-down with the boss. Sean, my hat's off to you and your strategic thinking‚Äîthough James Conner's 6.6 points was more like a wise guy trying to go straight. But hey, a win's a win, Sean, and you walked away with the respect this week. Brian? Better luck next time, kid. Remember, "Those who want respect, give respect."

**Rome wasn't built in Odunze vs Bozos Dobbed Over Circus League**

Alright, folks, let‚Äôs break it down, Soprano style. Bozos Dobbed Over Circus League, led by Peej, took Brendan's Rome wasn't built in Odunze to the cleaners, 135.6 to 109.1. Josh Allen was like a hitman who didn‚Äôt miss, racking up 24.4 points and making Jayden Daniels‚Äô 20.8 look like small potatoes. Derrick Henry was the only one in Brendan's crew really showing up, pulling in 25.2 points, but it was like bringing a knife to a gunfight. Now let‚Äôs talk mistakes. Brendan, how do you bench Jalen Hurts for Jayden Daniels? Hurts dropped 21.7 on the bench while Zack Moss barely showed up with 0.5. Jameson Williams left 17.7 on the bench too. Peej had Chris Boswell kicking up a storm with 17 points, while Najee Harris surprised everyone with 20.2. Brock Bowers chipped in a solid 16.1. Brendan, you gotta know when to hold ‚Äòem and when to fold ‚Äòem, otherwise you‚Äôre gonna be left with nothing but a gabagool sandwich. Peej, keep this up, and you might just make it to the top, but remember, "Those who want respect, give respect."

**Youngh03, Big Kupps vs Best Mahome in the Naberhood**

Alright, listen up! Brett's "Youngh03, Big Kupps" rolled into this matchup like they were gonna make a statement, but they got whacked by Jack's "Best Mahome in the Naberhood" with a crushing 151.6 to 98.5. You know, Brett, you really oughta have a sit-down with Marvin Harrison Jr. and Calvin Ridley. They combined for a whopping 0.9 points! That's not just a bad day; that's an insult to fantasy football. Meanwhile, Jack had Breece Hall and Brock Purdy putting in work like they were made guys, racking up 21.9 and 24.1 points, respectively. And let's not forget Deebo Samuel Sr. going off for 20.7 points‚Äîhe's the kind of guy you want on your crew. Brett's bench might as well have been in witness protection with no big performances. Jack, on the other hand, played it smart, leaving Patrick Mahomes on the bench. But with Brock Purdy's numbers, who needs 'em? In the end, Brett's streak of bad luck continues, and Jack walks out on top. Remember, Brett, "A wrong decision is better than indecision," but you made a few too many wrongs this time.

**Blue Dolphin vs LaPorta Della üëåüèº**

Alright, listen up, 'cause this ain't your grandmother's Sunday dinner. Nick's "Blue Dolphin" is swimming strong with a 123.9 to 105.2 win over Justin's "LaPorta Della üëåüèº." Jordan Love? More like Jordan Respect, am I right? The kid racks up 25.5 points, leaving Joe Burrow in his wake. Alvin Kamara didn't hit his projected numbers, but he still did his job better than some of the stiffs on Justin's team. D'Andre Swift? This guy's got more moves than a wiseguy dodging subpoenas, hitting 21.9 points. Meanwhile, Justin's Saquon Barkley might as well have been on the witness protection program with his 7.4 points. And let's not forget Dallas Goedert's zero‚Äîguess he took a nap. Justin could've had a shot if he started Dak Prescott, but he rode the pine like a mook. All due respect to Tank Dell for showing up with 18.7 points, but it wasn't enough to save the sinking ship. Remember, in this game, those who want respect, give respect. Better luck next time, Justin.
