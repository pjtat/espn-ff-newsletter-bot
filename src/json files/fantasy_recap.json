"### Week 4 Fantasy Football Recap: The Next Year's 8 Man League\n\nAh, Week 4 of the \u201cNext Year\u2019s 8 Man League,\u201d where dreams of fantasy glory clash with the harsh reality of players who forgot how to play football. Let\u2019s dive into the chaos and mockery that unfolded!\n\n---\n\n**Matchup 1: Three's a Stroud vs. Aiyuk to be a Piece of $h!t**\n\nIn a battle that can only be described as a dumpster fire, Chris\u2019s \"Three's a Stroud\" put up a respectable 107 points \u2014 which, let's face it, is a miracle given the roster. Meanwhile, Ryan\u2019s \"Aiyuk to be a Piece of $h!t\" didn't even break 100, crumbling to a pathetic 99.5. Jayden Daniels did his best to channel his inner superhero, scoring a solid 23.9, but the rest of Ryan's lineup couldn\u2019t find their collective asses with both hands. Chris's Derrick Henry decided to show up, flexing his muscles with 35.9 points, while Kyle Pitts scored a big fat zero. Ouch. Chris beat Ryan 107-99.5.\n\n---\n\n**Matchup 2: Youngh03, Big Kupps vs. Las Chubacabras**\n\nBrett\u2019s \"Youngh03, Big Kupps\" managed to score a decent 116.5, thanks mostly to the fact that Younghoe Koo must have had a personal vendetta against the opposing defense, racking up 20 points. Brian\u2019s \"Las Chubacabras,\" on the other hand, only managed to scrape together 111.9 points, which is like bringing a butter knife to a gunfight. Travis Etienne Jr. must have been too busy pondering life\u2019s existential questions, scoring just 7.0 points. Kyler Murray\u2019s 9.9 points were also a real kick in the nuts. Brett beat Brian 116.5-111.9.\n\n---\n\n**Matchup 3: Blue Dolphin vs. Bozos Dobbed Over Circus League**\n\nIn a matchup that was more one-sided than a toddler\u2019s tantrum, Nick\u2019s \"Blue Dolphin\" cruised to a whopping 149.8 points while Peej\u2019s \"Bozos Dobbed Over Circus League\" limped away with 112.6. Justin Jefferson returned from his extended vacation to drop 20.5 points, while Kyren Williams and Alvin Kamara reminded everyone they actually know how to play football. Josh Allen, meanwhile, must have been reading his own hype, only managing a measly 7.3 points. Nick beat Peej 149.8-112.6.\n\n---\n\n**Matchup 4: Best Mahome in the Naberhood vs. LaPorta Della \ud83e\udd2b\ud83c\udfff**\n\nIn a matchup that could only be described as \u201cwho cares,\u201d Jack\u2019s \"Best Mahome in the Naberhood\" collected 110.7 points, while Justin\u2019s \"LaPorta Della \ud83e\udd2b\ud83c\udfff\" squeaked by with 118.8. Talk about a nail-biter! Jack\u2019s Breece Hall scored a sad 3.8 points \u2014 maybe he was still recovering from his last game? Meanwhile, Jahmyr Gibbs decided he wanted to play football and dropped 19.8 points. Justin's Joe Burrow was just average, but enough to get the job done. Justin beat Jack 118.8-110.7.\n\n---\n\n**Matchup 5: D:cker Til She Waddles vs. Rome wasn't built in Odunze**\n\nSean\u2019s \"D:cker Til She Waddles\" narrowly lost to Brendan\u2019s \"Rome wasn't built in Odunze\" 118.6 to 166.1, which is like getting your lunch money stolen by a toddler. Sean\u2019s Lamar Jackson did the best he could, scoring 23.6 points, while Brendan\u2019s Derrick Henry decided to join the party with a whopping 35.9 points. Sean had a flex option in Carson Steele who scored a -0.4, because why not? Brendan had a solid performance across the board. Brendan beat Sean 166.1-118.6.\n\n---\n\n### Weekly Standouts\n\n- **Highest Score:** Nick\u2019s \"Blue Dolphin\" with a staggering 149.8 points.\n- **Trending Up:** Nick is strutting toward league dominance with a perfect record, while Chris is trying his hardest to escape the depths of the standings.\n- **Trending Down:** Ryan is still trying to figure out how to play this game, and Sean's team might as well be dead in the water.\n\n### Standings\n\n1. **1 (4-0)**: Blue Dolphin - Nick - 557.7\n2. **2 (4-0)**: Bozos Dobbed Over Circus League - Peej - 484.5\n3. **3 (3-1)**: Youngh03, Big Kupps - Brett - 510.9\n4. **4 (3-1)**: LaPorta Della \ud83e\udd2b\ud83c\udfff - Justin - 480.8\n5. **5 (2-2)**: Best Mahome in the Naberhood - Jack - 596.3\n6. **6 (1-3)**: Rome wasn't built in Odunze - Brendan - 520.5\n7. **7 (1-3)**: D:cker Til She Waddles - Sean - 480.5\n8. **8 (1-3)**: Las Chubacabras - Brian - 426.2\n9. **9 (1-3)**: Three's a Stroud - Chris - 416.8\n10. **10 (0-4)**: Aiyuk to be a Piece of $h!t - Ryan - 410.6\n\nUntil next week, may your players stay healthy and your fantasy dreams remain just that\u2014dreams!"
