"### Week 4 Fantasy Football Recap: Next Year's 8 Man League\n\nWelcome back to the circus that is the \"Next Year's 8 Man League,\" where the only thing more inconsistent than the weather is the fantasy performance of our beloved teams. Let\u2019s dive into this week\u2019s action, where dreams were crushed and hopes were dashed faster than a quarterback\u2019s knee in the playoffs!\n\n---\n\n#### Matchup 1: **Rome wasn't built in Odunze vs. Aiyuk to be a Piece of $h!t**\nBrendan\u2019s team decided to take a leisurely stroll through the fantasy landscape, scoring a whopping 166.1 points while Ryan\u2019s squad crumbled like a soggy taco at a buffet, finishing at a pitiful 99.5. Derrick Henry decided he wasn\u2019t just \u201cKing Henry\u201d but \u201cEmperor of Points,\u201d racking up 35.9 points like he was preparing for a royal banquet. Meanwhile, Ryan\u2019s Anthony Richardson looked less like a quarterback and more like a lost puppy, fetching only 5.2 points. What\u2019s worse? Starting Kyle Pitts, who must have been auditioning for a role in a drama as he scored an impressive 0.0. Brendan made Ryan\u2019s team look like the \u201cLittle Engine That Couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n**Final Score: Brendan beat Ryan 166.1 - 99.5**\n\n---\n\n#### Matchup 2: **Youngh03, Big Kupps vs. Las Chubacabras**\nBrett\u2019s squad came out with a 116.5-point explosion, leaving Brian\u2019s team in the dust with a mere 111.9. Brian\u2019s Keenan Allen tried to impress but ended up being more of a \u201cKeenan Average\u201d with only 4.9 points. Meanwhile, Brett\u2019s Kyler Murray was busy playing hide and seek with the end zone, but luckily, Younghoe Koo decided to show up, kicking 20 points like a boss. Let\u2019s not forget Brian\u2019s David Montgomery, who actually managed to score 15.0 points, which is like finding a $5 bill in your old winter coat. But alas, it wasn\u2019t enough to save his team from the clutches of defeat.\n\n**Final Score: Brett beat Brian 116.5 - 111.9**\n\n---\n\n#### Matchup 3: **Blue Dolphin vs. Three's a Stroud**\nNick\u2019s Blue Dolphin continued its mystical swim, defeating Chris\u2019s Three's a Stroud with a stellar 149.8 to 107.0. Justin Jefferson still must be on that \u201cWe Want a Refund\u201d tour, as he racked up 20.5 points, showing everyone why he\u2019s still the king of the wide receivers. Meanwhile, Chris's Bijan Robinson looked more like a lost kitten with only 11.4 points. The biggest shock? Jordan Love actually showed up for work, throwing 28.0 points on the board. Chris might want to consider a career change because at this rate, his fantasy team is going down faster than his stock portfolio.\n\n**Final Score: Nick beat Chris 149.8 - 107.0**\n\n---\n\n#### Matchup 4: **LaPorta Della \ud83d\udc12 vs. D:cker Til She Waddles**\nJustin\u2019s team squeaked by with a 118.8 to 118.6 victory over Sean\u2019s squad. It was like watching two cars in a slow-motion crash\u2014both teams barely scraping by. Justin\u2019s Jahmyr Gibbs had a decent outing with 19.8 points while Sean\u2019s CeeDee Lamb was busy reminding everyone why he\u2019s a fantasy darling with 23.6 points. But let\u2019s give a round of applause to Sean\u2019s Carson Steele, who achieved the impossible: scoring -0.4 points. In a world of mediocrity, these two teams put on a true display of \u201cwho wants to lose less.\u201d\n\n**Final Score: Justin beat Sean 118.8 - 118.6**\n\n---\n\n#### Matchup 5: **Best Mahome in the Naberhood vs. Bozos Dobbed Over Circus League**\nJack\u2019s team fell short against Peej\u2019s Bozos, losing 110.7 to 112.6 in a matchup that was as exciting as watching paint dry. Jack\u2019s Malik Nabers showed up with 23.1 points, but the rest of the crew forgot they had a game. Peej\u2019s Josh Allen was more of a \u201cJosh Underwhelming,\u201d scoring only 7.3 points, yet somehow still managed to pull off a win. It\u2019s unclear whether Jack\u2019s team is gearing up for a comeback or just practicing for next year\u2019s draft lottery. \n\n**Final Score: Peej beat Jack 112.6 - 110.7**\n\n---\n\n### Weekly Highlights:\n- **Highest Weekly Score**: Brendan\u2019s *Rome wasn't built in Odunze* with 166.1 points.\n- **Trending Teams**: Nick\u2019s *Blue Dolphin* is swimming toward the playoffs faster than a dolphin in a SeaWorld show, while Ryan\u2019s *Aiyuk to be a Piece of $h!t* is sinking like the Titanic.\n- **Worst Team**: Ryan\u2019s *Aiyuk to be a Piece of $h!t* is still looking for its first win and it\u2019s only Week 4\u2014good luck with that, buddy!\n- **Highest Overall Points Team**: Jack\u2019s *Best Mahome in the Naberhood* is racking up points but still can\u2019t buy a win. \n\n### Current Standings:\n1. **Nick (4-0)** - Blue Dolphin - 557.7 points\n2. **Peej (4-0)** - Bozos Dobbed Over Circus League - 484.5 points\n3. **Brett (3-1)** - Youngh03, Big Kupps - 510.9 points\n4. **Justin (3-1)** - LaPorta Della \ud83d\udc12 - 480.8 points\n5. **Jack (2-2)** - Best Mahome in the Naberhood - 596.3 points\n6. **Brendan (1-3)** - Rome wasn't built in Odunze - 520.5 points\n7. **Sean (1-3)** - D:cker Til She Waddles - 480.5 points\n8. **Brian (1-3)** - Las Chubacabras - 426.2 points\n9. **Chris (1-3)** - Three's a Stroud - 416.8 points\n10. **Ryan (0-4)** - Aiyuk to be a Piece of $h!t - 410.6 points\n\nAnd there you have it, folks!
