"**Week 4 Fantasy Football Recap: Next Year's 8 Man League - \"The League of Misfit Players\"**\n\n**Matchup 1: Three's a Stroud vs. Rome wasn't built in Odunze**  \nChris\u2019s squad decided they were auditioning for a soap opera this week, and boy, did they deliver a dramatic performance. With a solid score of 107.0 points, his players were clearly more interested in their careers as actors than actual football. Meanwhile, Brendan\u2019s team was over here doing the impossible\u2014scoring 166.1 points as if they were in a game of Madden on easy mode. Derrick Henry even decided to remind everyone that he is, in fact, a human bulldozer, ramming his way to a staggering 35.9 points. So, if you\u2019re keeping track, that\u2019s one team that looked like they were on the verge of a breakout and another that needs to consider a career change. Chris, pack your bags; Brendan beat you 166.1 to 107.0.\n\n**Matchup 2: Youngh03, Big Kupps vs. Las Chubacabras**  \nBrett must\u2019ve sprinkled fairy dust on his lineup because they magically appeared out of the depths of mediocrity to score a respectable 116.5 points. Meanwhile, Brian\u2019s team decided that scoring only 111.9 points was the equivalent of a participation trophy. Kyler Murray looked more like a scared kitten than a franchise QB, flopping with just 9.9 points\u2014good luck with that, buddy! Diontae Johnson showed up just in time to throw a party with his 21.3 points, while Brian\u2019s flex players were about as useful as a screen door on a submarine. In the end, Brett took home the W like a champ, beating Brian 116.5 to 111.9.\n\n**Matchup 3: Blue Dolphin vs. Bozos Dobbed Over Circus League**  \nNick\u2019s team strutted onto the field like it was the runway, scoring a jaw-dropping 149.8 points, while Peej\u2019s performers stumbled around, only managing 112.6. Justin Jefferson decided to remind us all why he\u2019s the GOAT, scoring 20.5 points while Kyren Williams and Alvin Kamara were doing their best to make sure they got a few good looks as well. On the other side, Josh Allen looked like he\u2019d rather be binge-watching Netflix than playing football, scoring only 7.3 points. Sorry, Peej, but it\u2019s clear your team needs a reality check. Nick crushed Peej 149.8 to 112.6.\n\n**Matchup 4: Best Mahome in the Naberhood vs. D:cker Til She Waddles**  \nJack\u2019s team must have felt like they were playing in a high school gym, scoring a measly 110.7 points against Sean\u2019s heroic effort of 118.6. CeeDee Lamb was the star of the show, strutting around with 23.6 points, while Jack\u2019s Patrick Mahomes barely made it out of the locker room with just 13.0 points. Breece Hall clearly decided that running was overrated because he scored a laughable 3.8 points. In the end, Sean\u2019s team showed up to play while Jack\u2019s squad was busy contemplating life choices. Sean beat Jack 118.6 to 110.7.\n\n**Matchup 5: LaPorta Della \ud83e\udd84 vs. Aiyuk to be a Piece of $h!t**  \nJustin\u2019s team must have stumbled across a treasure map because they scored 118.8 points, while Ryan\u2019s squad was just lost in the woods, managing a pathetic 99.5. Jahmyr Gibbs was the shining star for Justin, scoring 19.8 points, while Ryan's Anthony Richardson thought it was a race to the bottom with just 5.2 points. As for Kyle Pitts, it seems he\u2019s taken his \u201czero\u201d strategy a bit too seriously by scoring a big fat 0.0. Ryan, your team needs serious help, and it might be time to rethink those draft picks. Justin reigns supreme, beating Ryan 118.8 to 99.5.\n\n### Weekly High Score:\n**Brendan Fitzpatrick** of **Rome wasn't built in Odunze** with a whopping **166.1 points**.
