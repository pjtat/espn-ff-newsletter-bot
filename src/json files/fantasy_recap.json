"### Week 4 Fantasy Football Recap: The \"Next Year's 8 Man League\" Edition\n\n**Matchup 1: Rome wasn't built in Odunze vs. Aiyuk to be a Piece of $h!t**  \nIn a matchup that can only be described as a dumpster fire with a side of burnt popcorn, Brendan's \"Rome wasn't built in Odunze\" finally figured out that scoring 166.1 points is a good way to win. Derrick Henry decided to actually show up and scored a whopping 35.9 points, as if he was tired of being the league's favorite punching bag. Meanwhile, Ryan's \"Aiyuk to be a Piece of $h!t\" limped to a pathetic 99.5 points, with Anthony Richardson throwing a party for one with just 5.2 points. Kyle Pitts remains the poster child for disappointment, finishing with a solid 0.0 points\u2014turns out he\u2019s more of a spectator than a player. If you need a reminder of how low the bar is, remember that Ryan is now 0-4 and probably wonders if he should start looking for a new hobby. Brendan triumphed over Ryan 166.1-99.5.\n\n**Matchup 2: Youngh03, Big Kupps vs. Las Chubacabras**  \nBrett\u2019s \"Youngh03, Big Kupps\" found just enough magic to scrape by with a score of 116.5 against Brian\u2019s \"Las Chubacabras,\" who managed to produce a slightly more impressive 111.9 points. Kyler Murray attempted to play quarterback but apparently thought it was a game of hide-and-seek, finishing with a measly 9.9 points. Brian\u2019s team, meanwhile, had a fantastic showing from Justin Fields, who decided he\u2019d rather be a superstar than a benchwarmer with 31.9 points, though it wasn't enough to seal the deal. Poor Keenan Allen must have been lost on the field, contributing only 4.9 points; maybe he thought it was a bye week? Brett walked away victorious, defeating Brian 116.5-111.9.\n\n**Matchup 3: Blue Dolphin vs. Three's a Stroud**  \nNick\u2019s \"Blue Dolphin\" continued to swim circles around the competition with a dominating 149.8 points against Chris\u2019s \"Three's a Stroud,\" who floundered at 107.0. Justin Jefferson arrived to play, scoring 20.5 points while Chris probably wished he could have benched Bijan Robinson after his underwhelming 11.4 points. Jordan Love was channeling his inner MVP with 28.0 points, while J.K. Dobbins must have been in a different zip code with just 9.2 points. One has to wonder if Chris\u2019s team is a \u201cThree\u2019s a Crowd\u201d situation, as nobody seems to be stepping up when needed. Nick flexed his superiority with a win over Chris, 149.8-107.0.\n\n**Matchup 4: LaPorta Della \ud83e\udecc\ud83c\udffc vs. D:cker Til She Waddles**  \nIn the battle of the punny team names, Justin\u2019s \"LaPorta Della \ud83e\udecc\ud83c\udffc\" edged out Sean\u2019s \"D:cker Til She Waddles\" with a nail-biting score of 118.8 to 118.6. Yes, you read that right: Sean\u2019s team lost by a whopping 0.2 points, which is basically the same as getting punched in the gut by your own team. A classic case of \"if only\"\u2014if only CeeDee Lamb had done anything more than 23.6 points, Sean could have been celebrating instead of drowning in his sorrows. Meanwhile, Justin must be thanking his lucky stars for Jahmyr Gibbs, who racked up 19.8 points. Sean, who has been more of a spectator than a player this season, takes another L. Justin snatched the victory from Sean\u2019s grasp, 118.8-118.6.\n\n**Matchup 5: Best Mahome in the Naberhood vs. Bozos Dobbed Over Circus League**  \nJack\u2019s \"Best Mahome in the Naberhood\" tried to keep it interesting but ultimately fell short to Peej\u2019s \"Bozos Dobbed Over Circus League,\" who scored 112.6 points to Jack's 110.7. Jack\u2019s team was like a rollercoaster ride, with highs like Malik Nabers scoring 23.1 points, and lows like Breece Hall\u2019s 3.8 points\u2014guess he forgot how to run. Meanwhile, Peej\u2019s Josh Allen was off his game, scraping together just 7.3 points, but that\u2019s okay because Tyreek Hill took it upon himself to be the star of the show (kinda) with 8.2 points. It\u2019s like a race to the bottom, but Peej managed to cross the finish line just ahead of Jack. Peej beat Jack 112.6-110.7.\n\n### Weekly Standings:\n1. **1 (4-0)**  Blue Dolphin - Nick - 557.7\n2. **2 (4-0)**  Bozos Dobbed Over Circus League - Peej - 484.5\n3. **3 (3-1)**  Youngh03, Big Kupps - Brett - 510.9\n4. **4 (3-1)**  LaPorta Della \ud83e\udecc\ud83c\udffc - Justin - 480.8\n5. **5 (2-2)**  Best Mahome in the Naberhood - Jack - 596.3\n6. **6 (1-3)**  Rome wasn't built in Odunze - Brendan - 520.5\n7. **7 (1-3)**  D:cker Til She Waddles - Sean - 480.5\n8. **8 (1-3)**  Las Chubacabras - Brian - 426.2\n9. **9 (1-3)**  Three's a Stroud - Chris - 416.8\n10. **10 (0-4)**  Aiyuk to be a Piece of $h!t - Ryan - 410.6\n\n### Weekly Highlights:\n- **Top Scorer**: Brendan's \"Rome wasn't built in Odunze\" with 166.1 points. \n- **Trending Up**: Nick\u2019s \"Blue Dolphin\" is swimming towards a championship, while Ryan\u2019s \"Aiyuk to be a Piece of $h!t\" is on the fast track to the wooden spoon.\n- **High Scoring Champion**: Jack\u2019s \"Best Mahome in the Naberhood\" leads in overall points, yet finds himself in a mid-table battle.\n\nKeep those lineups sharp, folks!
