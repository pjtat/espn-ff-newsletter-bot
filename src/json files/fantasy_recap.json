He somehow managed to score an impressive 166.1 points, led by the mighty Derrick Henry, who decided to show up this week like he just got off the couch. Meanwhile, Ryan's team, Aiyuk to be a Piece of $h!t, flopped harder than your uncle's karaoke rendition of \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" finishing with a sad 99.5. Kyle Pitts? More like Kyle Whoops, am I right? \n\n**Final Score:** Brendan beat Ryan 166.1 - 99.5\n\n---\n\n**Matchup 2: Youngh03, Big Kupps vs. Best Mahome in the Naberhood**  \nBrett rolled out his squad and managed to scrape together a respectable 116.5 points, thanks to a somewhat decent performance from Diontae Johnson.

More like Patrick Meh-homes this week, am I right? \n\n**Final Score:** Brett beat Jack 116.5 - 110.7\n\n---\n\n**Matchup 3: Blue Dolphin vs. Three's a Stroud**  \nNick's Blue Dolphin continues to swim with the big fish, scoring a hefty 149.8 points, led by Jordan Love, who apparently decided to channel his inner Aaron Rodgers.
