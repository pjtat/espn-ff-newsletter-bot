    """
    Generates a funny recap of the latest fantasy football league results.
    """
    prompt = f"""
    Please provide a funny and engaging recap of the latest week's fantasy football league results.

    League Overview:
    - 10-team PPR league
    - Leage name is "Next Year's 8 Man League"
    - Starting lineup: 1 QB, 2 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE, 2 FLEX, 1 K
    - Teams ranked by wins, with total points as a tiebreaker
    - 14-week regular season, 3-week playoffs
    - Top 6 teams make playoffs; top 2 get a bye
    - The winner gets a trophy and bragging rights; last place gets punished

    League Team Data:
    {json.dumps(team_summary, indent=2)}

    Weekly Matchup Data:
    {json.dumps(boxscore_summary, indent=2)}

    Guidelines:
    - Highlight key matchups, surprise performances, and notable storylines.
    - Use sarcasm, humor, and be rude, edgy, and creative when mocking underperforming teams.
    - Use player data from the boxscores to comment on over- or under-performance, and missed starts.
    - Recap each of the 5 matchups in roughly 6 sentences.
    - Use ONLY the matchups provided in the Weekly Matchup Data. Do not invent or mix up matchups.
    - For each matchup, use the exact team names as they appear in the Weekly Matchup Data.
    - List team names (e.g., "Team A vs. Team B") at the start of each recap, ensuring they match the Weekly Matchup Data.
    - Always refer to owners by first name, which can be found in the League Team Data.
    - End each matchup with owner names and final scores (e.g., "Jake beat Brian 124.5-117.2"), using the exact scores from the Weekly Matchup Data.

    Standings:
    - Rank teams by their current rank value
    - For the standings, list the rank, record (W-L), team name, owner, and total points.
    - The team with the most wins should be ranked at the top, and teams with fewer wins should follow. If wins are tied, rank by total points (higher points comes first).

    End the entire recap with:
    - Listing the team that had the highest weekly score out of all the matchups.
    - Notes on how teams are trending towards becoming the league winner, the worst team, and the team with the highest overall points.
    - A listing of the standings including the rank, record (W-L), team name, owner, and total points.
